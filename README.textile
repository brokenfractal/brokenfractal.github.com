h1. This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I really liked the minimalism of "Tom's blog":http://mojombo.github.com. So I decided to copy his layout and removed his _posts/ and images/ and start fresh.
